## Technologies
For the development of our project we made use of the ReactJS framework.
In order to work with ReactJS efficiently, you need to have knowledge regarding JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5. Although ReactJS doesnâ€™t utilize HTML, JSX is quite the same as it.
Other than React, we used Firebase & Cloud Firestore for authentication and to integrate our database with our website.
